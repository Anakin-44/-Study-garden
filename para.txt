"It’s funny how we can talk for hours online about everything under the sun, yet when we’re actually standing next to each other, we can barely even look at one another. I still think about that day helping you with your scholarship documents—just us walking around, and you being your usual clumsy self, the way you’d inevitably slip on the stairs, making me want to catch you for the rest of my life.. I loved every second of it because it was just us. It frustrates me how you care for everyone else but completely ignore what you need; I wish you’d see yourself the way I see you. I know I’m not easy to love. I know my overthinking gets the best of me and I end up taking it out on you or doubting us, and it kills me that I’ve made you cry when you’re the one person who’s always stayed by me. I know we’ve talked about how a future together might not be possible because of things we can’t control. But even if we don't have a 'forever' or a house with a white fence at the end of this, it doesn't change what I feel right now. Maybe our story doesn't have a traditional happy ending, but the love we have is real, and it’s ours, and it will stay alive in its own way no matter where life takes us."

A Suggestion for the Surprise Page:
Since you’ve been building this dashboard, you could put this text in a "Hidden Letter" section. You could have an icon of a WhatsApp bubble or a Scholarship form that, when clicked, reveals this message.

Would you like me to help you code a "Typewriter Effect" for this paragraph? It would make the text appear one letter at a time, making it feel like you're "texting" her one last deep message.
